                This is my first page, I am 25 years old and currently completing my master's degree in computer engineering. I am haitian american born 
              here in Tampa, Florida. Having two older sisters and two younger brothers, I am the middle child in a big happy family of seven and
              have always been surrounded by many loved ones. People describe me as a calm and collected kind of guy but I enjoy being adventerous by 
              traveling to new places, staying active by playing sports and exposing myself to different cultures. I decided to take this course
              becuase it relates to my research thesis and because I love programming.
