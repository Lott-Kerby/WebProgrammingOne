              This is my first page, I am 25 years old and currently completing my master's degree in computer engineering. I am haitian american born 
              here in Tampa, Florida. Having two older sisters and two younger brothers, I am the middle child in a big happy family of seven and
              have always been surrounded by many loved ones. People describe me as a calm and collected kind of guy but I enjoy being adventerous by 
              traveling to new places, staying active by playing sports and exposing myself to different cultures. I decided to take this course
              becuase it relates to the research I do for my degree and because I love programming.
            </p>

              I actually started my academic career as a biomedical science major because I thought I wanted to be a doctor but that soon changed because
              I was too in love with things like video games, fixing computers and things generally relating to tech. It became evident that computers were
              always something I have been naturally good at so I decided to change my major to computer engineering. I graduated in 2018 and am continuing my
              master's with a concentration in brain computer interfaces. My dream is to use this technology to help people with learning disorders improve
              their attention and focus using training programs.

              As I stated in my about me section above, I enjoy sports and traveling. So far I have visited the following locations: 
              cities all over Florida, A NASA facility in Hunstville AL, Atlanta GA, Phoenix AZ, Grand Canyon, New York City and Haiti. Next on my
              bucket list is California, Spain and Venice Italy. On my free time I play lots of basketball and football and when I am not doing that
              I am probably reading something online learning something new!
